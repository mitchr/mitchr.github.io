		How many petals does $r=\sqrt{|\sin(n\theta)|}$ have for $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$ and a positive integer $n$? I saw this question on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/eqvhfo/how_many_pedals_does_the_curve_r_sqrt_sinn%CE%B8_have />reddit</a> a while back and I typed out a quick sketch of a proof on my phone in the comments there, but I wanted to do something a little more formal here. While thinking about this problem I generated the images below which made me intuitively think that the answer was $2n$, so why not claim this is true and try to prove it.
		<br><br>

		<div class="container text-center">
			<div id="plot"></div>
			<div id="display">$n=2$</div>
			<input id="slider" type="range" class="form-control-range" min="1" max="20" value="2">
		</div>

		<br><br>

		<b>Claim.</b> $r=\sqrt{|\sin(n\theta)|}$ has $2n$ petals.
		<br><br>
		<b>Proof.</b> From the graphs above, we can see that petals are only formed when $\sqrt{|\sin(n\theta)|}$ becomes zero. We can imagine starting from the origin and tracing out the petal shape so that we arrive back at the origin. Therefore we must be at the origin $2n+1$ times to form $2n$ petals (it is $2n+1$ instead of $2n$ because we always start at $\theta=0$, and $\sin(0)=0$). We have equated the problem of finding the number of petals with finding the number of zeros of our function, and proving one will also prove the other.

		<br><br>

		We will first make some simplifications that will make it easy for us to see when our function becomes zero. Suppose $f(\theta)=\sqrt{|\sin(n\theta)|}$ and that $f(c)=0$ for some $c\in[0,2\pi]$. Then it must be the case that $f^2(c)=0$. So now let's look at $f^2(\theta)=|\sin(n\theta)|$. Suppose $f^2(d)=0$ for some $d\in[0,2\pi]$. The only way for this to occur is if $\sin(n\theta)=0$. So now instead of finding the zeros of the more complex function $f$, we can instead find the zeros of the simpler expression $\sin(n\theta)$.

		<br><br>

		In general, the zeros of $\sin\alpha$ occur when $\alpha=m\pi$ for some $m\in\mathbb{Z}$. In our case, $\alpha=n\theta$, so $\theta = \frac{m\pi}{n}$. Since $m$ can be any (positive) integer, we know at the very least that when $\theta$ is $0$ $(m=0)$ or $2\pi$ $(m=2n)$, $f$ will be zero. We can then work backwards from this information and find the remaining values of $m$ that will also make $f$ zero. Let's try listing some of these multiples to get a better idea of what we're dealing with:

		$$
		\left\{ 0, \frac{\pi}{n}, \frac{2\pi}{n}, \frac{3\pi}{n}, \dots, 2\pi-\frac{2\pi}{n}=\frac{(2n-2)\pi}{n}, 2\pi-\frac{\pi}{n}=\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{n}, 2\pi \right\}
		$$

		The cardinality of this set is the number of zeros of $f$, which we can see is $2n+1$. $\Box$
