		<h3 class="h3">Skewed 5-Point Stencil for Laplace Equation on a Rectangular Boundary</h3>
		<span id="date">May 30, 2020</span>
		<br>

		In the <a href="03-18-20.html">last post</a> we derived the rotated 5-point stencil for the Laplace equation, though at the end we made the simplification that $h=k$ which forced us into using a square boundary. But what if we want to use a boundary that is rectangular shaped (meaning $h \neq k$)? We'll have to change our approach here a little bit. Instead of the derivation we did last time which involved Taylor approximations, we'll think that about what happens to a standard grid under a $45^{\circ}$ clockwise rotation.

		$$
		\begin{aligned}
		u_{i, j-1} &\to u_{i-1, j-1} \\
		u_{i-1, j} &\to u_{i-1, j+1} \\
		u_{i+1, j} &\to u_{i+1, j-1} \\
		u_{i, j+1} &\to u_{i+1, j+1} \\
		\end{aligned}
		$$

		<p>
			Now that all of our nodes have been moved to their new locations, we should think about what happens to $h$ and $k$. For calculating the new vertical distance $k'$, consider the triangle formed by the nodes $u_{i,j}, u_{i,j+1}, u_{i+1,j+1}$ (we could also consider the triangle formed by $u_{i,j}, u_{i,j-1},u_{i-1,j-1}$, but the result is the same). The hypoteneuse of this triangle is $\sqrt{h^2+k^2}$, which is also $k'$. The new horizontal distance $h'$ is found in a similar way by looking at the triangle formed by $u_{i,j}, u_{i-1, j}, u_{i-1, j+1}$ (or $u_{i,j}, u_{i+1,j}, u_{i+1, j-1}$). The hypotoneuse of this triangle is also $\sqrt{h^2+k^2}$, so $h'=k'$ under this transformation.
		</p>

		The equation for the standard finite difference stencil is
		$$u_{i+1, j} + u_{i-1,j} + \frac{h^2}{k^2}u_{i,j+1} + \frac{h^2}{k^2}u_{i,j-1} - \left(2+2\frac{h^2}{k^2}\right)u_{i,j} = 0$$

		In order to construct our finite difference equation for the rotated stencil, we just have to look at the apply our $45^{\circ}$ transformation:

		$$u_{i+1, j-1} + u_{i-1,j+1} + u_{i-1,j+1} + u_{i-1,j-1} - 4u_{i,j} = 0$$

		<p>
			Since $h'=k'$, these drop out and we are left with the clean looking equation above that is not dependent on the step-sizes of either axis.

		<h4 class="h4">Constructing the coefficient matrix</h4>

		Suppose $D_n$ is an $(n \times n)$ matrix with the form
		$$\begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\
		1 & \ddots & \ddots \\
		& \ddots & \ddots & 1\\
		& & 1 & 0
		\end{bmatrix}$$
		with zeros everywhere except the first sub- and super-diagonals. Then we can construct the coefficient matrix $A$ by using the Kronecker product (denoted with $\otimes$) using $D_n$ and the identity matrix $I_n$:

		$$A = \left(I_{m-1} \otimes -4I_{n-1}\right) + \left(D_{m-1} \otimes D_{n-1}\right)$$

		There may be a more efficient way to produce this matrix quickly, but this method seemed to work well enough for all the problems I tested it on. Using this matrix, we can construct the matrix equation $Au=b$ where $b$ contains the boundary condition information. Then we can solve for the interior nodes by Gaussian elimination $u=A \backslash b$. Here's the equation for $n=m=5$:

		$$
		\begin{bmatrix}
		-4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & -4 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & -4 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & -4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -4 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -4 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -4 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \\
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
		u_{2,2} \\
		u_{3,2} \\
		u_{4,2} \\
		u_{2,3} \\
		u_{3,3} \\
		u_{4,3} \\
		u_{2,4} \\
		u_{3,4} \\
		u_{4,4} \\
		\end{bmatrix}
		=
		\begin{bmatrix}
		- u_{1,3} - u_{3,1} - u_{1,3} \\
		- u_{2,1} - u_{4,1} \\
		- u_{3,1} - u_{5,1} - u_{5,3} \\
		- u_{1,2} - u_{1,4} \\
		0 \\
		- u_{5,2} - u_{5,4} \\
		- u_{1,3} - u_{1,5} - u_{3,5} \\
		- u_{2,5} - u_{4,5} \\
		- u_{5,3} - u_{3,5} - u_{5,5} \\
		\end{bmatrix}
